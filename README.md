# Roadmap to Data Science and Machine Learning (RDScML)
An exhaustive study guide to learn machine learning concepts from scratch. It focuses on preparing an individual through detailed exploration and hands-on implementation of the concepts. The concepts are to be learned by solving the issues that are brilliantly crafted by experienced personnel. Post this, there are three major projects:
1. Great Energy Prediction
2. COVID-19 Visualization
3. Quora Insincere Questions Classification

These projects on solving would reflect the detailed knowledge and understanding of three main data science aspects:

1. Algorithmic Knowledge
2. Building Visual Deliverables
3. Natural Language Processing Applications

## Contribution Guidelines
#### Working on an issue:
1. `git remote add upstream git@github.com:archisha-chandel/RDScML.git`, to be done once only.
2. `git pull upstream master`
3. `git branch <name_of_the_branch>` OR `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`
4. Create a titled .ipynb file which contains the details as explained by the issue or make the changes that you want.
5. `git status`
6. `git add <file_name>`, stage only those files that you want to commit.
7. `git commit -m "<commit_message>"`, eg: git commit -m "solves issue 2" or git commit -m "adds notebook"
8. `git push`

#### Creating a pull request:
- Specify the issue number that the pull request is fixing in the description section:
`Fixes: #<issue_number>`
- Give a suitable title to the pull request.
- Also, add a few statements explaining what the pull request is about.
