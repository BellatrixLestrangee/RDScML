# Roadmap to Data Science and Machine Learning (RDScML)
An exhaustive study guide to learn machine learning concepts from scratch. It focuses on preparing an individual through detailed exploration and hands-on implementation of the concepts. The concepts are to be learned by solving the issues that are brilliantly crafted by experienced personnel. The solutions submitted via pull requests will be reviewed carefully and constructive feedback will be given. Post this, there are three major projects:
1. Great Energy Prediction
2. COVID-19 Visualization
3. Quora Insincere Questions Classification

These projects on solving would reflect the detailed knowledge and understanding of three main data science aspects:

1. Algorithmic Knowledge
2. Building Visual Deliverables
3. Natural Language Processing Applications

## Timeline
The following timeline can be followed by any learner. It is highly recommended to study these topics by reading articles on Medium, Towards Data Science, IEEE research papers and other scholarly articles. Popular YouTube channels can also be followed, like
1. Machine Learning Recipes with Josh Gordon
2. Natural Language Processing Zero to Hero by Laurence Moroney
3. Deeplearning.ai
4. Machine Learning- Andrew Ng, Stanford University (full course)
5. StatQuest with Josh Starmer

## Contribution Guidelines
#### Working on an issue:
1. `git remote add upstream git@github.com:archisha-chandel/RDScML.git`, to be done once only.
2. `git pull upstream master`
3. `git branch <name_of_the_branch>` OR `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`
4. Create a titled .ipynb file which contains the details as explained by the issue or make the changes that you want.
5. `git status`
6. `git add <file_name>`, stage only those files that you want to commit.
7. `git commit -m "<commit_message>"`, eg: git commit -m "solves issue 2" or git commit -m "adds notebook"
8. `git push`

#### Creating a pull request:
- Specify the issue number that the pull request is fixing in the description section:
`Fixes: #<issue_number>`
- Give a suitable title to the pull request.
- Also, add a few statements explaining what the pull request is about.
